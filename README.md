Battles of Batch is a game which runs on Window's MS-DOS terminal. It's an RPG text game, where you fight enemies in various battles. This project was started by 136MasterNR in 13th August 2021.

## Download/Installation Process, Requirements & Notes
  - **Download the wizard here**: [BattlesOfBatch-Setup.exe](https://htssoft.tk/get-download/BattlesOfBatch-Setup.exe) [LATEST RELEASE]
  - **Download manually here**: [battlesofbatch-latest.zip](https://htssoft.tk/get-download/battlesofbatch-latest.zip) [LATEST RELEASE]

Battles of Batch is currently only available on Windows, with a required command line version at least 10.0.1 and higher.

This project uses [ANSI](https://www.robvanderwoude.com/ansi.php) as a text formatter. We use [ANSI](https://www.robvanderwoude.com/ansi.php) to format the colors on the window and manage displayed text. It is required for almost anything to work properly.

Please note that downloading the game from the source code is not recommended because it contains features which are yet not finished or not tested out. The source code also contains files that are not yet added to the original game. Please consider installing by the wizard or downloading a release instead!

**Warning: Your antivirus might detect the wizard as a malware, but that's a false positive. I coded the wizard in PowerShell and converted it to EXE using  [PS2EXE](https://github.com/MScholtes/PS2EXE) which is falsely detected as a malware due to vandalism on the software. If you are unable to whitelist the wizard, please consider using the manual download which was mentioned above, or a release in this repository. You can also find the source code of it in the [installer](/installer) folder.**

## Strategy Methods
### How it Works : Enemies (#3.0)
  - Enemies spawn with a random amount of HP, the amount increases depending on the level you have selected.
  - Enemies deal a random amount of damage to the player, the amount increases depending on the level you have selected.
  - Every enemy deals its own damage, so this means once one enemy is dead it will no longer deal damage, dealing less total damage to the player.

### How it Works : Skills (#3.1)
  - **Main Attack**: Increases your base damage.
  - **Crit Rate**: Increases the chance to throw a critical strike to an enemy.
  - **Max Health**: Increases maximum HP by 100.

### How it Works : Items (#3.2)
  - **Bomb**: Stuns enemies, skipping their next round/action. Bosses cannot be stunned by this attack type. Effects, such as poison on the player, will still function.
  - **Heal**: Gives the player HP. This does not skip the next enemy round/action, and still take damage. Thus it's upgradable.
  - More coming soon.

### How it Works : Crafting Items [FUTURE UPDATE]
  - You can craft items by accessing the Shop, and switching to the Craft tab. Every item requires materials for it to be crafted, once you gather all required materials, you will be able to craft your item.
  - Items serve a rich in-game usage. You can equip weapons and other items such bombs or healing pots through your inventory. Weapons usually give you a big boost when it's about fighting enemies, they can give you extra damage and bonus effects.

# Explaining Technical Features
### Gameplay Features
  - More Info Soon!

### Saves Manager
  - Where your data are stored:
    - All your data of our porjects are saved on a single local directory in your appdata; `%appdata%\HTS_DATA`. Battles of Batch's directory is named after its PHASE and VERSION. On `%appdata%\HTS_DATA`, you will find the game named as `BATTLESOFBATCH-%PHASE%-%VERSION%`. `%PHASE%` means the stage of the project, and `%VERSION%` the game version. E.g. `BATTLESOFBATCH-INDEV-0245`. Under that directory are the child directories `SAVES` and `SETTINGS`, plus some other `.dll` true/false files. On your first startup of the game, it automatically creates the player data saves under your game's appdata path directory.
  - How the saving system works:
    - The game automatically saves your progress every time your player data variables are modified. The program does not rewrite the whole save file, it only modifies lines on it. For example, if you complete a quest, it will only change the line where that quest is saved on, that also goes for total completed levels, items and more.
  - Creating multiple saved profiles:
    - Coming Soon!

### Audio Manager
  - The audio is played by a Visual Basic script, which is managed by the Audio Manager, a batch file. The Audio Manager is always running in the background as a seperate task, unless you have turned sounds & music off. It detects whether the game is running every 1 second, and if it's not, it stops the audio tasks, and then itself. The way to detect whether the game is running is to try to access a file which is being used by the game contantly. On the start up of the game, the game sets a file as the logger, and that file cannot be accessed by other programs for as long the program which is using it (the game) is running.

### Auto Updater
  - The updater starts and checks for updates automatically when you start the game. It pulls information from [get-update](https://github.com/136MasterNR/HTS-Studios/tree/main/get-update), compares your local game's version with the online version and then prompts to you whether to update or not before completely loading into the game. After you confirm to update, the updater will pull the whole game from [get-download](https://github.com/136MasterNR/HTS-Studios/tree/main/get-download) and will replace all your old game files with the new game files. This will not reset your saves, but if the next update requires you to reset your saves, you will be prompted for a second confirmation.

### Error Handler
  - More Info Soon!

### Use Commands for Devs
  - Go to the menu, and type `cmd`, then type `commands` to list all available dev cmds. If shortcut keys enabled, hit CTRL + T.
    - **clear**: Clears the console window.
    - **debug**: Enables manual debugging mode, it gives more information on some User Interfaces, and reverts some User Interfaces back to preDev versions.
    - **import**: Display an [ANSI](https://www.robvanderwoude.com/ansi.php) text file. Use `.ans` as a file type. Use an argument after the command, e.g. `import mysupertxt.ans`. Make sure to move your ansi text in the directory `.\data\cmds\`.
    - **help**: See more information and all the commands.

# FAQ
  - Q: **Why in Batch?**
    - A: **I started this project as a challenge for myself. Making a game in such a tricky and badly-made langauge might have been hell, but a great challenge.**
