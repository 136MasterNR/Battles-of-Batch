## Strategy Method
### How it Works : Enemies (#3.0)
  - Enemies spawn with a random amount of HP.
  - Enemies deal a random amount of damage to the player.
  - Every enemy deals its own damage, so this means once one enemy is dead it will no longer deal damage, dealing less total damage to the player.

### How it Works : Skills (#3.1)
  - Main Attack: More Info Soon!
  - Crit Rate: More Info Soon!
  - Max Health: More Info Soon!

### How it Works : Items (#3.2)
  - Bomb: Stuns enemies, skipping their next round/action. Bosses cannot be stunned by this attack type. Effects, such as poison on the player, will still function.
  - Heal: Gives the player HP. This does not skip the next enemy round/action, and still take damage. Thus it's upgradable.
  - More coming soon.

### How it Works : Materials (#3.3)
  - Coming soon.


## User Interfaces
### Shop (4.0)
  - Items: Items require in-game currency and specific character level. The level requirement is replaced by the symbol "↑", and currency by the symbol "$".
