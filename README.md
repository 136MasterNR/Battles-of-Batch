Battles of Batch is a game which runs on Window's MS-DOS terminal. It's an RPG text game, where you fight enemies in various battles. This project was started by 136MasterNR in 13th August 2021.

## Download/Installation Process, Requirements & Notes
  - **Download the wizard here**: [BattlesOfBatch-Setup.exe](https://htssoft.tk/get-download/BattlesOfBatch-Setup.exe) [LATEST RELEASE]
  - **Download manually here**: [battlesofbatch-latest.zip](https://htssoft.tk/get-download/battlesofbatch-latest.zip) [LATEST RELEASE]

Battles of Batch is currently only available on Windows, with a required command line version at least 10.0.1 and higher.

This project uses ANSI as a text formatter. We use ANSI to format the colors on the window and manage displayed text. It is required for almost anything to work properly.

Please note that downloading the game from the source code is not recommended because it contains features which are yet not finished or not tested out. The source code also contains files that are not yet added to the original game. Please consider installing by the wizard or downloading a release instead!

**Warning: Your antivirus might detect the wizard as a malware, but that's a false positive. I coded the wizard in PowerShell and converted it to EXE using  [PS2EXE](https://github.com/MScholtes/PS2EXE) which is falsely detected as a malware due to vandalism on the software. If you are unable to whitelist the wizard, please consider using the manual download which was mentioned above, or a release in this repository.**

## Strategy Method
### How it Works : Enemies (#3.0)
  - Enemies spawn with a random amount of **HP.
  - Enemies deal a random amount of damage to the player.
  - Every enemy deals its own damage, so this means once one enemy is dead it will no longer deal damage, dealing less total damage to the player.

### How it Works : Skills (#3.1)
  - **Main Attack**: More Info Soon!
  - **Crit Rate**: More Info Soon!
  - **Max Health**: More Info Soon!

### How it Works : Items (#3.2)
  - **Bomb**: Stuns enemies, skipping their next round/action. Bosses cannot be stunned by this attack type. Effects, such as poison on the player, will still function.
  - **Heal**: Gives the player HP. This does not skip the next enemy round/action, and still take damage. Thus it's upgradable.
  - More coming soon.

### How it Works : Materials (#3.3)
  - Coming soon.
